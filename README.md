Google Tag Manager for WordPress - MAINTAINED!
================================

This GitHub repo was created to allow others to easily contribute to this WordPress plugin. You can find more about the plugin at [the plugin homepage](https://gtm4wp.com/)
I am not sure what happened with the previous and original plugin, so I decided to create this fork and maintain all the needed changes through here.
